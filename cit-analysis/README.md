Recursive queries for citation network analysis
===============================================

This diretory contains the code of recursive queries that analyze citation networks on cit-Patents dataset[2] in SQL databases.
Based on the citation analysis workloads for datalog in the literature[1], we made the following SQL queries:

1. `01.TC.sql`: Transitive closure query
2. `02.SG.sql`: Same generation query
3. `03.REACH.sql`: Reachability query
4. `04.SSSP.sql`: Single-source shortest paths query
5. `05.CC.sql`: Connected components query


## Steps to run the queries in a SQL database

1. Download `cit-Patents.txt.gz` from https://snap.stanford.edu/data/cit-Patents.html and place it in the same directory as `mkdata.sh`.
2. Unzip `cit-Patents.txt.gz` to create `cit-Patents.txt`.
3. Run `mkdata.sh` to create a file to be loaded into a database. This script will create a file named `CPAT-tmp.txt` in the same directory.
4. Create a table `EDGE` in a database using `schema.sql`, which is a DDL file for Hitachi Advanced Database (HADB), but can be easily modified for other databases.
5. Load `CPAT-tmp.txt` into the table.
